# UFO Sightings

## Overview
The purpose of the Module 11 Challenge was to create a website that allowed the user to filter on a date (only 2010 was available in the data file), a city, a state, a country, and UFO shape.  To complete the assignment, it was required to successfully do the following:
1.  create the five elements for filtering
2.  Detect changes through the event listener
3.  Use a function to save the element, vlaude and id of the filter that was changed
4.  Create a function that loops through the filters and keeps the data that matches the filter values
5.  Correctly displays the results of the user inputs

## Results
Searching the data through the filters is very easy.  One can simply enter a date, a city, a state, country or shape.  In an example below, the date 1/8/2010 has been entered, Fort Worth for the city, US for the country, and the shape of chevron:

Another way to search the data is to only choose one option and then see all of the results.  In this example, I have chosen only to fill in the shape of circle.  Below are all of the circle shaped sightings for any date (in 2010), any city, and any country:

# UFO Sightings

## Overview
The purpose of the Module 11 Challenge was to create a website that allowed the user to filter a file of UFO sigting data based on a date (only 2010 was available in the data file), a city, a state, a country, and/or UFO shape.  To complete the assignment, it was required to successfully do the following:
1.  Create the five elements for filtering
2.  Detect changes through the event listener
3.  Use a function to save the element, value and id of the filter that was changed
4.  Create a function that loops through the filters and keeps the data that matches the filter values
5.  Correctly display the results of the user inputs

## Results
Searching the data through the filters is very easy.  One can simply enter a date, a city, a state, country or shape.  In an example below, the date 1/8/2010 has been entered, Fort Worth for the city, US for the country, and the shape of chevron:

Another way to search the data is to only choose one option and then see all of the results.  In this example, I have chosen only to fill in the shape of circle.  Below are all of the circle shaped sightings for any date (in 2010), any city, and any country:

## Summary
While this website is very useful in searching UFO sighting data, the webpage could be more user friendly.  For example, the user may not know all of the different shapes and how they have been uniquely named in the datafile.  As an ehnancement, the shape should be made into a drop down so that the user does not have to guess.  Additionally, the user should be able to choose the month, day, and year separately.  Lastly, the data is only for 2010; a more complete or updated datafile should be available for the user to search as well.  If these minor upgrades were made, the website would be more interactive and provide the user a better experience when searching UFO sightings.
